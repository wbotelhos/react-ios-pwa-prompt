> Polyfilling PWAs for iOS

A React component that provides a customisable Progressive Web App (PWA) prompt telling the user to 'Add to Home Screen'. The prompt behaviour is baked in to Android devices, yet iOS is still lagging behind. This component aims to provide a simple way to provide this functionality on iOS for websites that are PWA-ready. The prompt styles closely match iOS designs for both light and dark UI modes to appear native to the user.

## Features

- üõ† Fully configurable, set how many times you want to see it, and after how many page visits.
- üìÉ PWA available offline? In full screen mode? Customise the content of your prompts message through props.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Efficient. Very little overhead for non-iOS devices and does as little work as needed for each page load.
- üåï Light & dark mode available depending on user's settings.

## Usage

1. Add `react-ios-pwa-prompt` as a dependency using `pnpm add react-ios-pwa-prompt`.

2. Import into your project:

```
import PWAPrompt from 'react-ios-pwa-prompt'
```

3. Render the component:

4. Add optional props to configure:

```
<PWAPrompt promptOnVisit={1} timesToShow={1} copyClosePrompt="Close" />
```

4. Create your own trigger rules
   You can easily set your own trigger conditions if you don't like the consecutive page loads approach. For example:

```
const [shouldShowPWAPrompt, setShouldShowPWAPrompt] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
    // 20% chance of popping up
    setShouldShowPWAPrompt(Math.random() < 0.2)
}, [])

return (
    <PWAPrompt isShown={shouldShowPWAPrompt} />
)
```
